Salsero y Salsera, we have been through stressful times in our daily lives. At times, we may have been looking for a getaway to relax and also looking to get some Salsa dance fix while doing so.

Imagine if you can just relax by the beach of a beautiful island in the weekendwhile doing some Salsa dance there. Like a Salsa holiday. Here is some spoiler of what is about to be described:
