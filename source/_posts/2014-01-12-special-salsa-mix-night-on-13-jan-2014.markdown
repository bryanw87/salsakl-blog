Since the coming Tuesday (14-Jan-2014) is a holiday, most of us salsero and salsera would definitely have our legs itching to go out to dance on Monday (13-Jan-2014) night itself.

With that, both [DJ Gary](http://www.salsakl.com/#!/djs/dj-gary) and [DJ Selva](http://www.salsakl.com/#!/djs/dj-selva) have decided to host a special Monday night Salsa for all!
