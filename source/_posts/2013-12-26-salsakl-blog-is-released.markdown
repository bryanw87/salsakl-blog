## SalsaKL Blog Is Up
Hi all, SalsaKL's blog page is up and running! Thank you so much your patience and continuous support for [SalsaKL](http://www.salsakl.com)!

## Purpose
This blog is intended to dessimate information to all on what is happening within the Salsa scene in Klang Valley, covering information such as:

- Updates on Salsa social dance scene
- Updates on Salsa dance academy happenings
- Salsa dance events

<!--more-->

## Goal
The main intention of [SalsaKL](http://www.salsakl.com) and [this blog](http://blog.salsakl.com) is to solve the problem of unavailability of centralized information to those who are new to the Salsa dance scene and even existing ones. It would be great to see this as a community driven project to keep up the Salsa dancing spirit high up in Klang Valley.

Thank you again for reading this and last but not least, keep calm and Salsa dance.
