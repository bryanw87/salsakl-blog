Chinese New Year (CNY) 2014 is close at hand.

For most of us, it is all about the preparation of food and drinks and family reunions. For some of us, it is a thought on "Where can I get my usual dance fix for this weekend?".

For those who think they are going to be itching to get a dance fix this coming CNY weekend, fret not, for there will be Salsa social this weekend!
