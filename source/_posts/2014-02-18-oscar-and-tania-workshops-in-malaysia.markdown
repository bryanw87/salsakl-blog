To all you dance enthusiasts out there, there would potentially be a dance workshop by [Oscar and Tania](http://www.facebook.com/OscarAndTania)! Why this is termed as potentially, because 12 sign ups for the full package of the workshop is **required** to make this a confirmation.

Tania came to Malaysia before for the previous [SalsaLah 2013](http://www.facebook.com/events/398730120242789/â€Ž) and feedback by most of regarding her workshops and performance is good.
